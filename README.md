# Expo Starter DX - Mobile Development Starter Kit

Welcome to my Expo Template! I've designed this to kickstart your mobile development journey with ease. This template provides a basic setup for mobile developers, including essential tools and configurations to streamline your development process. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I aim to simplify your workflow and enhance productivity.

## Features

- **Expo**: Get started quickly with Expo, a framework and platform for universal React applications. Expo simplifies the process of building, deploying, and iterating on mobile apps.
- **Prettier**: Maintain consistent code formatting across your project with Prettier. Forget about manually formatting your code; let Prettier handle it for you.
- **ESLint**: Catch errors and enforce coding standards with ESLint, a pluggable JavaScript linter. ESLint helps you maintain code quality and consistency throughout your project.
- **Lint-staged**: Optimize your development workflow by running ESLint and Prettier only on staged files. Lint-staged ensures that only relevant files are checked, improving performance and efficiency.
- **Jest**: Implement tests using Jest, a delightful JavaScript testing framework. Write unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and stability of your application.
- **Expo App Router**: Simplify navigation in your Expo app with Expo App Router. Easily manage navigation between screens and create a seamless user experience.
- **Predefined Visual Studio Code Settings**: Enjoy predefined settings for Visual Studio Code, including recommended extensions, editor settings, and workspace configurations to enhance your development experience.

## Getting Started

1. Initialize the project using your preferred package manager:

   ```
    npx create-expo --template https://github.com/DanielMarkiel/expo-starter-dx
   ```

   ```
    yarn create expo --template https://github.com/DanielMarkiel/expo-starter-dx
   ```

   ```
    pnpm create expo --template https://github.com/DanielMarkiel/expo-starter-dx
   ```

   ```
    bun create expo --template https://github.com/DanielMarkiel/expo-starter-dx
   ```

   - check the [create-expo-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) docs for details.

1. Navigate to the project directory.
1. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
1. Prerebuild the app by running `npx expo prebuild`.
1. Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
1. Follow the instructions provided by Expo to run your app on an emulator, simulator, or physical device.
1. Begin developing your mobile app by modifying the source code and adding your features.

## Usage

- **Prettier**: Prettier is configured to automatically format your code on save. You can customize Prettier settings in the [.prettierrc](.prettierrc) file.
- **ESLint**: ESLint will analyze your code and report any errors or warnings. You can adjust ESLint rules and configurations in the [.eslintrc.js](.eslintrc.js) file.
- **Lint-staged**: Before committing your changes, lint-staged will run ESLint and Prettier on staged files. Ensure that your code meets the defined standards before pushing to version control.
- **Jest**: Write tests for your components, functions, and application logic using Jest.
- **Expo App Router**: Utilize Expo App Router to handle navigation between screens in your Expo app. Refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for detailed usage instructions.
- **Predefined Visual Studio Code Settings**: Open this project in Visual Studio Code and enjoy predefined settings for a smoother development experience. Make sure to install the recommended extensions and take advantage of the configured editor settings and workspace configurations.
